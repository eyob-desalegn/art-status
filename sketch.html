        Sketching is a fantastic skill that lets you transfer your design idea onto
       paper in the most fun, fast and effective way. In other words, sketching
        is a unique instrument for visualizing your concepts. Nowadays, it is 
        associated mostly with such media as specialized professional markers, 
        for example, Copic, Stylefile, Chartpak, Promarkers, ZIG, etc. 
        Sketching “palette” is vast and versatile: you can start from scratch 
        by using a pencil, charcoal, or black liner and end up by using different 
        types of colouring techniques, for instance, watercolour, coloured ink and
         pastel or watercolour pencils. It is possible to mix various media,
          for example, markers + pastel or watercolour + coloured pencils.
       There are so many creative opportunities for you to test and explore!
        It is a good idea to try several and pick a couple of “favourites”<br>

        The reason why sketching became so popular today among designers of
         all kinds not only in Russia, Europe, the USA, Asia, and the rest
          of the world is that artists nowadays tend to be overwhelmed by 
          computer programs such as CAD, Revit, Sketchup, 3D Max, and Maya. 
          In the old days, artists were earning their bread by, literally, their
           hands, and now they are desperately wishing to go back in time when ideas
         were transferred through hand drawing, which is far more natural and organic way of doing it.

   I heard that portray drawing is the most neccesary thing we should do
   in architectural entrance exam.But this thing could also help us in 
   different way,like if we like  drawing 3D images this portray drawing 
   can help us to go through it.I spoted this portray drawing in architectural 
   view in some kind of practice that can help me understand how to look something
   as it is   
   <br>
   <br>
   <img src="04.jpg" width="400" height="300">
  <br>

  <img src="07.jpg" width="400" height="300">

  <br>

  as I mentioned in the above this portray drawings makes a lot of benefits in 
  any ways, because it is something that can help on 3D pattern picture drawings.
  so therefore it can help me in the architectural 3d drawings.

  <br>
<br>
  eventually I would like to say that arts and architecture are much related in There
  actions.I tried to show you some of my experiance in relating with architecture
  and art.I think this would be a helpfull experiance sharing.

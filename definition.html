        Art is a process of creating things of extrinsic value through emotional
        or aesthetic appeal and Architecture has many definition but we can 
        can say it is a both the process and product of planning, designing 
        and construction. <br>
        
       drawing pictures is the most amusing thing that attract the eyes
       of many people.
       drawing for me is like having a language that does not have a word
       that express it.but we now that it gives meaning for those who have
       seen it, of course there are drawings that are hard to understand 
       like abstract drawing.
       Abstract drawing are very profound in there character,it tries to 
       express a certain  feelings in one paint but in different form, thats
       why people are unable to identify its meaning. 
      <br>
      here allow me to show you some of my drawings I have been doing since 
      the closure of class.
      <br>
       <img src="01.jpg" width="200" height="300">
       <img src="02.jpg" width="200" height="300">
       <br>
       <img src="03.jpg" width="200" height="300">
       <br>
       I do this whole bunch of things because I thought it may help me in
      my architectural entrance examination.But this is not the only reason
     I have,it's just I thought the architectural part is the main one.

     In my perspective and background understanding architecture and art are 
     very relative. Both try to bring somthing that is in mind,and also both 
     perform their action in similar way like sketching designing and the like.

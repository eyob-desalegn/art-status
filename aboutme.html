        Hello, My name is Eyob And I am a graphic designer as well as an urban planning and design student.
        I started to persue the graphic designing after I joined The urban planning and design course in 
        Addis Ababa university since 2019. These causes me to expertise the graphic design side by side.
        most of my designs are related to the urban parts, But I have also made a logo design, a motion 
        design and some other related designs.I used Adobe photoshop, Adobe illustrator, Adobe premier pro
        and Asobe after effect. There are also some other softwares that are used for Urban planning and
        design such as GIS, And Auto Cad. Furthermore I am interested in art or drawings.

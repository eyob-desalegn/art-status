        I designed this programing to show how art inspire architecture and to answer 
        for those who are seeking to join architecture having the question, whether
        being an artist is beneficiary or not when joining to the architecture
        I designed it in both my perspective and others perspective.
        the first page deals with the definition of art and architecture and 
        their contents and the cause of doing art.the second page deals with how sketching helps to the
        architecture and some other things and the last page deals with how portray
        drawings is helping in architectural entrance exam.
